# Wiisx (not the emulator)
Murderous Miis on a god damn PS1 LOL

## Compilation
You know the drill, read [COMPILE.md](/COMPILE.md).


## Disclaimer
This is a port of Mii Funkin: VS Eteled to Playstation one. This was made with permission from TheMaskedChris.

This is also a modified version of PSXFunkin, by CuckyDev.

Also, I forgot there was a PSX Wii emulator called WiiSX when I made this repo, so if you are looking for that, you are in the wrong place lol.

Credits can be found in the game itself, and the gamebanana page.
